# pi-interactive-subagents

Async subagents for [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) — spawn, orchestrate, and manage sub-agent sessions in multiplexer panes. **Fully non-blocking** — the main agent keeps working while subagents run in the background.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30adb156-cfb4-4c47-84ca-dd4aa80cba9f

## How It Works

Call `subagent()` and it **returns immediately**. The sub-agent runs in its own terminal pane. A live widget above the input shows all running agents with their current state — `starting`, `active`, `waiting`, `stalled`, or `running`. When a sub-agent finishes, its result is **steered back** into the main session as an async notification — triggering a new turn so the agent can process it.

```
╭─ Subagents ──────────────────────────── 2 running ─╮
│ 00:23  Scout: Auth (scout)        active · bash 7m │
│ 00:45  Scout: DB (scout)                waiting 2m │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

For parallel execution, just call `subagent` multiple times — they all run concurrently:

```typescript
subagent({ name: "Scout: Auth", agent: "scout", task: "Analyze auth module" });
subagent({ name: "Scout: DB", agent: "scout", task: "Map database schema" });
// Both return immediately, results steer back independently
```

## Install

```bash
pi install git:github.com/HazAT/pi-interactive-subagents
```

Supported multiplexers:

- [cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
- [zellij](https://zellij.dev)
- [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) (terminal emulator with built-in multiplexing)

Start pi inside one of them:

```bash
cmux pi
# or
tmux new -A -s pi 'pi'
# or
zellij --session pi   # then run: pi
# or
# just run pi inside WezTerm — no wrapper needed
```

Optional: set `PI_SUBAGENT_MUX=cmux|tmux|zellij|wezterm` to force a specific backend.

If your shell startup is slow and subagent commands sometimes get dropped before the prompt is ready, set `PI_SUBAGENT_SHELL_READY_DELAY_MS` to a higher value (defaults to `500`):

```bash
export PI_SUBAGENT_SHELL_READY_DELAY_MS=2500
```

## What's Included

### Extensions

**Subagents** — 4 main-session tools + 3 commands, plus 1 subagent-only tool:

| Tool                 | Description                                                                                 |

### Bundled Agents

| Agent             | Model                  | Role                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **planner**       | Opus (medium thinking) | Brainstorming — clarifies requirements, explores approaches, writes plans, creates todos |
| **scout**         | Haiku                  | Fast codebase reconnaissance — maps files, patterns, conventions                         |
| **worker**        | Sonnet                 | Implements tasks from todos — writes code, runs tests, makes polished commits            |
| **reviewer**      | Opus (medium thinking) | Reviews code for bugs, security issues, correctness                                      |
| **visual-tester** | Sonnet                 | Visual QA via Chrome CDP — screenshots, responsive testing, interaction testing          |

Agent discovery follows priority: **project-local** (`.pi/agents/`) > **global** (`~/.pi/agent/agents/`) > **package-bundled**. Override any bundled agent by placing your own version in the higher-priority location.

## Async Subagent Flow

```
1. Agent calls subagent()          → returns immediately ("started")
2. Sub-agent runs in mux pane      → widget shows live status
3. User keeps chatting             → main session fully interactive
4. Sub-agent finishes              → result steered back as a normal completion/failure
5. Main agent processes result     → continues with new context
```

Multiple subagents run concurrently — each steers its result back independently as it finishes. The live widget above the input tracks all running agents:

```
╭─ Subagents ───────────────────────────────── 3 running ─╮
│ 01:23  Scout: Auth (scout)            active · write 7m │
│ 00:45  Researcher (researcher)               stalled 4m │
│ 00:12  Scout: DB (scout)                      starting… │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Completion messages render with a colored background and are expandable with `Ctrl+O` to show the full summary and session file path.

### In-progress status updates

The widget tracks each Pi-backed sub-agent from a child-written runtime snapshot and labels it with a coarse state:

- `starting` — launched, but no valid child snapshot has been observed yet
- `active` — the child is doing observed runtime work: agent turn, provider request, streaming, or tool execution
- `waiting` — the child finished a turn and is intentionally open for more input or another stage
- `stalled` — the parent has gone too long without a valid current child snapshot and can no longer trust the run is healthy
- `running` — fallback for backends without child snapshots (e.g. Claude)

These labels are no longer derived from session-file growth. Session JSONL is still used for transcript, resume, lineage, and result extraction, but Pi-backed liveness now comes from a small activity snapshot written by the child extension. A fixed internal watchdog marks a run as `stalled` when valid snapshots never appear, stop being readable, or stop matching the current child; valid long-running `active` or `waiting` states do not become `stalled` just because time passes. When a run enters `stalled` or recovers from it, the parent agent receives a steer message so it can react. All other status transitions stay in the widget only.

**Interactive subagents stay silent.** Long-running user-driven subagents (e.g. `planner`, or any `/iterate` fork) do not wake the parent session on `stalled`/`recovered` transitions — the user is working directly in the subagent's pane, and a steer message there would just burn an orchestrator turn on a no-op "still waiting" ping. The widget still updates normally, and child snapshots are still recorded/classified regardless of the `interactive` setting. By default, agents with `auto-exit: true` are treated as autonomous and get stall pings; agents without it are treated as interactive and stay quiet. Override per-agent with `interactive: true|false` in frontmatter, or per-spawn with `interactive: true|false` on the tool call.

#### Configuration

Status display is controlled by `config.json` in the extension directory. Copy `config.json.example` to get started:

```bash
cp config.json.example config.json
```

```json
{
  "status": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

`config.json` is gitignored so local overrides don't get committed.

## Spawning Subagents

```typescript
// Named agent with defaults from agent definition
subagent({ name: "Scout", agent: "scout", task: "Analyze the codebase..." });

// Force a full-context fork for this spawn
subagent({ name: "Iterate", fork: true, task: "Fix the bug where..." });

// Agent defaults can choose a different session-mode via frontmatter
subagent({ name: "Planner", agent: "planner", task: "Work through the design with me" });

// Custom working directory
subagent({ name: "Designer", agent: "game-designer", cwd: "agents/game-designer", task: "..." });
```

### Parameters

| Parameter              | Type    | Default        | Description                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                 | string  | required       | Display name (shown in widget and pane title)                                                     |

## Interrupting a running subagent

Use `subagent_interrupt` to cancel the active turn of a running Pi-backed subagent:

```typescript
subagent_interrupt({ id: "abcd1234" });
// or
subagent_interrupt({ name: "Scout" });
```

This sends Escape to the child pane, cancelling the in-progress model turn. The subagent session stays alive — the pane, session file, and background polling all remain intact. After the interrupt, the widget immediately moves the child back to `waiting`, and stale pre-interrupt snapshots are ignored. If the child starts work later, newer snapshots return it to `active`; completion, failure, and `caller_ping` still flow through normally.

This is a turn-level interrupt, not a method for forcibly terminating a subagent session.

> **Note:** Only Pi-backed subagents are supported. Claude-backed runs will return an error.

---

## caller_ping — Child-to-Parent Help Request

The `caller_ping` tool lets a subagent request help from its parent agent. When called, the child session **exits** and the parent receives a notification with the help message. The parent can then **resume** the child session with a response using `subagent_resume`.

**Parameters:**
- `message` (required): What you need help with

**Interaction flow:**
1. Child calls `caller_ping({ message: "Not sure which schema to use" })`
2. Child session exits (like `subagent_done`)
3. Parent receives a steer notification: *"Sub-agent Worker needs help: Not sure which schema to use"*
4. Parent resumes the child session via `subagent_resume` with the response
5. Child picks up where it left off with the parent's guidance

**Example:**
```typescript
// Inside a worker subagent
await caller_ping({
  message: "Found two conflicting migration files — should I use v1 or v2?"
});
// Session exits here. Parent receives the ping, then resumes this session
// with guidance like "Use v2, v1 is deprecated"
```

> **Note:** `caller_ping` is only available inside subagent contexts. Calling it from a standalone pi session returns an error.

## The `/plan` Workflow

The `/plan` command orchestrates a full planning-to-implementation pipeline.

```
/plan Add a dark mode toggle to the settings page
```

```
Phase 1: Investigation    → Quick codebase scan
Phase 2: Planning         → Interactive planner subagent (user collaborates)
Phase 3: Review Plan      → Confirm todos, adjust if needed
Phase 4: Execute          → Scout + sequential workers implement todos
Phase 5: Review           → Reviewer subagent checks all changes
```

Tab/window titles update to show current phase:

```
🔍 Investigating: dark mode → 💬 Planning: dark mode
→ 🔨 Executing: 1/3 → 🔎 Reviewing → ✅ Done
```

---

## The `/iterate` Workflow

For quick, focused work without polluting the main session's context.

```
/iterate Fix the off-by-one error in the pagination logic
```

This always forks the current session into a subagent with full conversation context. It does not inherit an agent default `session-mode`. Make the fix, verify it, and exit to return. The main session gets a summary of what was done.

---

## Custom Agents

Place a `.md` file in `.pi/agents/` (project) or `~/.pi/agent/agents/` (global):

```markdown
---
name: my-agent
description: Does something specific
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
thinking: minimal
tools: read, bash, edit, write
session-mode: lineage-only
spawning: false
---

# My Agent

You are a specialized agent that does X...
```

| `session-mode` | string | Default child-session mode: `standalone`, `lineage-only`, or `fork` |
| `spawning`    | boolean | Set `false` to deny all subagent-spawning tools                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `deny-tools`  | string  | Comma-separated extension tool names to deny                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `auto-exit`   | boolean | Auto-shutdown when the agent finishes its turn — no `subagent_done` call needed. If the user sends any input, auto-exit is permanently disabled and the user takes over the session. Recommended for autonomous agents (scout, worker); not for interactive ones (planner). Also determines the default value of `interactive` (see below). |
| `interactive` | boolean | derived        | Override whether stall/recovery transitions wake the parent session. Defaults to the inverse of `auto-exit`: autonomous agents (`auto-exit: true`) are non-interactive and get stall pings; agents without `auto-exit` are interactive and stay quiet. Explicit values take precedence. |
| `cwd`         | string  | Default working directory (absolute or relative to project root)                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `disable-model-invocation` | boolean | Hide this agent from discovery surfaces like `subagents_list`. The agent still remains directly invokable by explicit name via `subagent({ agent: "name", ... })`. |

---

Discovery still resolves precedence before visibility filtering. If a project-local hidden agent has the same name as a visible global or bundled agent, the hidden project agent wins and the lower-precedence agent does not appear in `subagents_list`.

### `session-mode`

Choose how a subagent session starts:

- `standalone` — default fresh session with no lineage link to the caller
- `lineage-only` — fresh blank child session with `parentSession` linkage, but no copied turns from the caller
- `fork` — linked child session seeded with the caller's prior conversation context

`lineage-only` is useful when you want session discovery and fork lineage UX to show the relationship later, but you do **not** want the child to inherit the parent's turns.

`fork: true` on the tool call always forces the `fork` mode for that specific spawn. `/iterate` uses this explicit override on purpose.

```yaml
---
name: planner
session-mode: lineage-only
---
```

### `auto-exit`

When set to `true`, the agent session shuts down automatically as soon as the agent finishes its turn — no explicit `subagent_done` call is needed.

**Behavior:**

- The session closes after the agent's final message (on the `agent_end` event)
- If the user sends **any input** before the agent finishes, auto-exit is permanently disabled for that session — the user takes over interactively
- The modeHint injected into the agent's task is adjusted accordingly: autonomous agents see "Complete your task autonomously." rather than instructions to call `subagent_done`

**When to use:**

- ✅ Autonomous agents (scout, worker, reviewer) that run to completion
- ❌ Interactive agents (planner, iterate) where the user drives the session

```yaml
---
name: scout
auto-exit: true
---

### `interactive`

Controls whether status transitions (`stalled`, `recovered`) wake the parent session with a steer message.

**Default:** the inverse of `auto-exit`. Autonomous agents (`auto-exit: true`) are non-interactive and ping the parent on stall/recovery; agents without `auto-exit` are interactive and stay quiet. Bare spawns with no agent defs (e.g. `/iterate` with `fork: true`) are treated as interactive.

**Why it exists:** Interactive agents can run for minutes or hours while the user thinks, types, and reads in the subagent's pane. Child snapshots still update the widget, but stalled/recovered supervision messages rarely need to wake the parent for user-driven sessions. Skipping the steer keeps the parent quiet until the child actually finishes.

**When to override:**

- Set `interactive: false` on an agent that doesn't auto-exit but you still want stall pings for
- Set `interactive: true` on an autonomous agent you'd rather check on yourself

```yaml
---
name: planner
# interactive defaults to true because auto-exit is not set
---
```

Or per spawn:

```typescript
subagent({ name: "Scout", agent: "scout", interactive: true, task: "..." });
```

## Tool Access Control

By default, every sub-agent can spawn further sub-agents. Control this with frontmatter:

### `spawning: false`

Denies all subagent lifecycle tools (`subagent`, `subagent_interrupt`, `subagents_list`, `subagent_resume`):

```yaml
---
name: worker
spawning: false
---
```

### `deny-tools`

Fine-grained control over individual extension tools:

```yaml
---
name: focused-agent
deny-tools: subagent
---
```

### Recommended Configuration

| Agent      | `spawning`  | Rationale                                    |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| planner    | _(default)_ | Legitimately spawns scouts for investigation |
| worker     | `false`     | Should implement tasks, not delegate         |
| researcher | `false`     | Should research, not spawn                   |
| reviewer   | `false`     | Should review, not spawn                     |
| scout      | `false`     | Should gather context, not spawn             |

## Role Folders

The `cwd` parameter lets sub-agents start in a specific directory with its own configuration:

```
project/
├── agents/
│   ├── game-designer/
│   │   └── CLAUDE.md          ← "You are a game designer..."
│   ├── sre/
│   │   ├── CLAUDE.md          ← "You are an SRE specialist..."
│   │   └── .pi/skills/        ← SRE-specific skills
│   └── narrative/
│       └── CLAUDE.md          ← "You are a narrative designer..."
```

```typescript
subagent({ name: "Game Designer", cwd: "agents/game-designer", task: "Design the combat system" });
subagent({ name: "SRE", cwd: "agents/sre", task: "Review deployment pipeline" });
```

Set a default `cwd` in agent frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: game-designer
cwd: ./agents/game-designer
spawning: false
---
```

---

## Tools Widget

Every sub-agent session displays a compact tools widget showing available and denied tools. Toggle with `Ctrl+J`:

```
[scout] — 12 tools · 4 denied  (Ctrl+J)              ← collapsed
[scout] — 12 available  (Ctrl+J to collapse)          ← expanded
  read, bash, edit, write, todo, ...
  denied: subagent, subagents_list, ...
```

## Requirements

- [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) — the coding agent
- One supported multiplexer:
  - [cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux)
  - [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
  - [zellij](https://zellij.dev)
  - [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/)

```bash
cmux pi
# or
tmux new -A -s pi 'pi'
# or
zellij --session pi   # then run: pi
# or
# just run pi inside WezTerm
```

Optional backend override:

```bash
export PI_SUBAGENT_MUX=cmux   # or tmux, zellij, wezterm
```
